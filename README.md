This responsive site was built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with a strong focus on user experience and aesthetic clarity.
Each animal is introduced through a clean, card-based layout and accompanied by personal stories that add emotional depth to the interface.

The modal galleries support both arrow navigation and touch swipe gestures for mobile users, providing an intuitive way to browse images.
Typography, color palette, and micro-interactions were carefully chosen to create a calm and affectionate atmosphere that reflects the project’s theme.
