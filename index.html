    <h2>Jilly</h2>
    <p>
      Jilly is the undisputed princess of the house — elegant, sweet, and full of personality. She was the first to steal everyone’s heart and always knows how to get cuddles… with impeccable style, of course.

    <h2>Pippo</h2>

    <h2>Saverio</h2>
    <p>
      Saverio is the first cat who truly won me over. Shy at first, he turned out to be the sweetest cuddle bug. He naps just about anywhere, loves being petted, and has that clever little look that melts your heart.
