  <h2>Our Stories</h2>

  <div class="story">
    <h3>Jilly 4 years old</h3>
    <p> I adopted Jilly four years ago, when she was just a puppy. 
      A volunteer had rescued her and her siblings after they were abandoned. 
      From the very beginning, Jilly was a lively little troublemaker full of energy, 
      always running around, and curious about everything. As she grew, she turned into a graceful and elegant lady, 
      still playful at times but with a more refined charm. 
      She’s the princess of the house, no doubt about it, and she knows it. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="story">
    <h3>Pippo maybe 9 years old</h3>
    <p>Pippo came into my life four years ago from the local shelter, where he had spent three long years waiting for someone to notice him. 
      He had been found wandering alone through the countryside, and judging by his cautious nature and sharp instincts, he may have once belonged to a hunter.
       When we first met, he didn’t jump or bark he simply walked up to me with a gentle look, as if he already knew he was coming home. 
      Pippo is calm, noble, and deeply loyal a quiet soul with a protective heart.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="story">
    <h3>Saverio 1 year old</h3>
    <p>Saverio was born right in my garden, under a big bush near the wall. 
      He was the friendliest and most playful of the litter, unlike his more timid brother who kept his distance.
       One day, Saverio just waltzed into the house like he already owned the place — and never left. Since then, he’s become a permanent part of the family: 
       affectionate, curious, and always ready for a game or a nap in the coziest corner he can find.</p>
